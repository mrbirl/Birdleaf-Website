					<p>
						We worked long and hard to help our customers understand theirs. We gave it our all, but unfortunately the time has come for Birdleaf to close. We have have been incredibly fortunate to have such amazing companies as our customers, and we have done everything possible to improve Birdleaf to suit your needs best over the past year. Unfortunately we are unable to continue to progress Birdleaf and have had to make the difficult decision to close.
					</p>
					<p>
						We would like to thank all our customers for your support - it has been massively appreciated from the start, and it has been great working with you all.
