				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a while now the biggest requested feature from all our customers was the ability to manage multiple lists of emails. Today we&#8217;ve added the ability to quickly create, rename and delete lists of emails from anywhere in Birdleaf <img src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><a href="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-13.17.26.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1010" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-13.17.26-610x227.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-07-20 at 13.17.26" width="300" height="112" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-13.17.26-610x227.png 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-13.17.26-930x346.png 930w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-13.17.26-403x150.png 403w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-13.17.26-1400x521.png 1400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-13.17.26-400x149.png 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-13.17.26-300x112.png 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-13.17.26.png 1478w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s how it works:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Click the dropdown at the top of the screen to see the list menu.</li>
<li>Type in the name of your new list (e.g. &#8216;Top Customers&#8217;) and click the green tick.</li>
<li>You will be brought to the &#8216;<a href="http://app.birdleaf.io/#/add-emails">Add Emails</a>&#8216; page to add some emails to your new list. (There&#8217;s help on that <a href="http://birdleaf.io/troubleshooting-a-list-import">here</a> if needed.)</li>
<li>The emails will be added to that list. You can now visit the Analytics and Raw Data pages to see data for the emails in that list.</li>
<li>From any page, click the drop down menu at the top to switch to a different list. To rename or delete a list just click the pencil or bin icons beside any list name.</li>
</ol>
<p>The &#8216;All Emails&#8217; list shows every email added to every list you have. This is a special, permanent list that can&#8217;t be deleted or renamed.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-14.20.55.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1011" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-14.20.55-610x264.png" alt="Files Added" width="300" height="130" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-14.20.55-610x264.png 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-14.20.55-930x403.png 930w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-14.20.55-347x150.png 347w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-14.20.55-400x173.png 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-14.20.55-300x130.png 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-14.20.55.png 998w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Show Added Files</b></p>
<p>The add emails page also now shows you the files have been added to that list in the past, to allow you to quickly see what you&#8217;ve put into each list.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google Drive is close to the top of the list when it comes to what application I use most during the day. It&#8217;s a really useful tool for marketers, from taking notes at conferences to creating surveys for blog content and being able to access all your documents across multiple devices.</p>
<p>Google Drive has really upped its game of late. You get up to 15GB for free, 100GB for $2 a month, or 1TB for $9.99 a month. Hard to complain with that. While Google Drive is easy to use you may not be aware that there are several easy(free) ways to get even more out of the service.  You can use Drive save space on your hard drive, recover old version of a file, save content straight from a website and much, much more.</p>
<p>Check out the list of Google Drive tricks to make your work even more productive.</p>
<h3><strong>1) Use Drive to attach larger files to emails</strong></h3>
<p>Google Drive has made sending files and photos as email attachments sexy again, apparently. When you’re attaching files from you computer, you can only attach files up to 25 MB. But, by inserting files using Drive, you can now send a file up to 10 GB. The recipients can easily view them online. And if the files aren&#8217;t shared, Google Drive will prompt you to do that before the email is sent.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-8441 size-full" style="border: 1px solid #86c177;" title="Google Drive Tricks_Attachment" src="http://clouddock.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Drive_Attachment.png" alt="Google Drive Tricks_Attachment" width="335" height="200" /></p>
<p>Also unlike traditional attachments where you have to wait for the file to upload, attaching a file through Drive doesn’t require you to re-upload the file. Simps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>2) File Versions</strong></h3>
<p>If you collaborate on documents with colleagues or clients it helps to see exactly what changes were made and who made them. Did you know you can use Google Drive for this? Drive keeps 30 days worth of file revisions (up to 100 versions).</p>
<p>To view older versions of the file, just head to the Google Drive website:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">1. Navigate to the file you want to see the revision history of.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">2. Right click on the file and click <strong>Manage revisions…</strong> from the drop down menu.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-8461 size-full" style="border: 1px solid #86c177;" title="Google Drive Tricks_Version Control" src="http://clouddock.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Version-Control.png" alt="Google Drive Tricks_Version Control" width="333" height="373" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">3. Now you can see all the versions of the file as it was updated.</p>
<p>Unlike Dropbox, if you rename the file or change the file location you can still see the history of the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>3) Make Google Drive your default documents folder</strong></h3>
<p>You might want to make Google Drive as the default documents folder considering the features it offers.</p>
<p>For Mac users, Open Terminal (in Utilities) and type <strong>cd Google\ Drive/</strong>. Hit enter, and then type <strong>In –s~/documents /documents</strong>. Hit enter again and watch the magic happen.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-8561" style="border: 1px solid #86c177;" title="Google Drive Tricks_Terminal OSX" src="http://clouddock.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Drive_Terminal-OSX.png" alt="Google Drive Tricks_Terminal OSX" width="579" height="101" /></p>
<p>For windows users, right-click on your <strong>Documents </strong>folder, click <strong>Properties</strong>, click <strong>Include a folder</strong>, choose your Google Drive folder and finally select it and click <strong>Set save location</strong>. And that’s it, next time you save a document in a program like Microsoft Word; Google Drive will be selected as the default save location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>4) Work Offline </strong></h3>
<p>Make files available offline so you can view them when your phone or tablet loses service, like on a plane or in a building with a bad connection.</p>
<p>To make files available offline just head to the Google Drive app on your phone or tablet:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">1. Navigate to the file you want to be available offline.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">2. Click on the <strong>Info icon</strong> to the right of the file name.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-8661" style="border: 1px solid #86c177;" title="Google Drive Tricks_Offline" src="http://clouddock.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Drive_Offline1.png" alt="Google Drive Tricks_Offline" width="381" height="430" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">3. Slide the <strong>Available Offline </strong>toggle to On.</p>
<p>Now that file will be saved to your mobile device so you can view and edit it when you’re offline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>5) Restore file from bin</strong></h3>
<p>Accidentally deleted a file from Google Drive on the desktop? No biggie, just head to the Google Drive website and log in to its online version, click <strong>Bin</strong> on the left menu. And there you go, all the files you’ve deleted.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-8621" style="border: 1px solid #86c177;" title="Google Drive Tricks_Recover from Bin" src="http://clouddock.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Recover-from-Bin.png" alt="Google Drive Tricks_Recover from Bin" width="418" height="195" /></p>
<p>Now all you have to do is check the box beside the file you want to recover and just click <strong>Restore</strong>. Emergency over!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>6) Use Forms to Collect Data</strong></h3>
<p>Google Forms lets you run a survey or quickly create a team roster with a simple online form. Whatever information has been input into the form will be automatically compiled into a spreadsheet, neatly organised so you can analyse the results.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-8641" style="border: 1px solid #86c177;" title="Google Dirve Tricks_Google Form" src="http://clouddock.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Google-Form.png" alt="Google Dirve Tricks_Google Form" width="337" height="265" /></p>
<p>To create a Form just head to the Google Drive website, click on the <strong>Create</strong> option and select <strong>Form. </strong>From here you’ll be able to set up the form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>7) Use stars to flag key files</strong></h3>
<p>Stars allow you to identify important files for quick access. To &#8220;star&#8221; a file, just head to the Google Drive website or the mobile app and click on the star on the left hand side of the file name.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-8711" style="border: 1px solid #86c177;" title="Google Drive Tricks_Star File" src="http://clouddock.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Drive_Star-File.png" alt="Google Drive Tricks_Star File" width="361" height="141" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>8) Annotation App</strong></h3>
<p><a style="color: #86c177;" href="http://www.gingerlabs.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Notability</strong></a> is really responsive note taking and annotating app that ensures there&#8217;s no more A4 pads or sticky notes cluttering up your office. You can import files from Google Drive and add your own notes to the document. So if you&#8217;re asked to review a new sales contract, you can import the document from Google Drive, add your notes, and upload it back to Drive so everyone can see your feedback. You can also automatically back up the notes to Google Drive as PDFs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15089" src="http://clouddock.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Dropbox_productivity_apps_notability.jpg" alt="Dropbox_productivity_apps" width="295" height="368" /></p>
<p><a style="color: #86c177;" href="http://www.gingerlabs.com/" target="_blank">Notability</a> ($4.99) | Availability <a style="color: #86c177;" href="https://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/notability/id360593530?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a></p>
<h3><strong>9) Document Editor</strong></h3>
<p>This one is a bit less straight forward as Google have split up the Drive editing suite, meaning you now require standalone apps to edit documents. For the Google format files you’ll need to download <a style="color: #86c177;" href="http://www.google.ie/docs/about/" target="_blank">Docs</a>, <a style="color: #86c177;" href="http://www.google.ie/sheets/about/" target="_blank">Sheets</a>, and <a style="color: #86c177;" href="http://www.google.ie/slides/about/" target="_blank">Slides</a> apps. For Microsoft Office format files &#8211; Word, Powerpoint, and Excel &#8211; you can use Quickoffice. However, Google have recently announced they are going to push an update to beef up the Drive editing apps to allow you edit MS Office files, but it hasn’t been released yet.</p>
<p><a href="http://clouddock.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Google_Drive_Productivity_Apps_Quickoffice.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15149" src="http://clouddock.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Google_Drive_Productivity_Apps_Quickoffice.jpg" alt="Google_Drive_Productivity_Apps_Quickoffice" width="295" height="369" /></a></p>
<p><a style="color: #86c177;" href="http://www.google.ie/docs/about/index.html" target="_blank">Drive Editing Apps</a> (Free) | Availability <a style="color: #86c177;" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-docs/id842842640?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a> &amp; <a style="color: #86c177;" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs.editors.docs&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Android</a></p>
<h3><strong>10) Save to Google Drive</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">As you might guess from the name, this extension lets you save <span style="color: #444444;">content from anywhere on the web and store it neatly in Drive. Once the extension is installed, anytime you see a link or an image you want, you simply right click on the content and select the &#8220;Save to Google Drive&#8221; option. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15121" src="http://clouddock.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Chrome-Extensions-For-Google-Drive_Save-to-Drive.jpg" alt="Chrome-Extensions-For-Google-Drive_Save-to-Drive" width="550" height="337" /></p>
<p><a style="color: #86c177;" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-google-drive/gmbmikajjgmnabiglmofipeabaddhgne/details" target="_blank">Save to Google Drive</a> (Free)</p>
<h4><strong>11) Black Menu</strong></h4>
<p>This extension is an in-browser pop-up so to speak, that gives you access to all Google services &#8211; probably making your overall Google experience better, not just Drive. The Drive page allows you to easily upload a file directly in Black Menu for Google, or create a new document via the create menu. It also provides a search bar so you can search your entire Drive account without having to leave the web page you&#8217;re on.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15116" src="http://clouddock.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Chrome-Extensions-For-Google-Drive_Black-Menu.jpg" alt="Chrome-Extensions-For-Google-Drive_Black-Menu" width="550" height="337" /><br />
<a style="color: #86c177;" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/black-menu-for-google/eignhdfgaldabilaaegmdfbajngjmoke" target="_blank">Black Menu</a> (Free)</p>
<h4><strong>12) Save text to Google Drive</strong></h4>
<p>Similarly to &#8216;Save to Google Drive&#8217;, this extension lets you save content from the web to Google Drive. Except instead of images and links, you can save web text content. If you see an article you want to save, all you do is hit the &#8220;Save Text to Google Drive&#8221; extension and all the text in the article will be saved to a new document in Drive.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15120" src="http://clouddock.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Chrome-Extensions-For-Google-Drive_Save-Text-to-Google-Drive.jpg" alt="Chrome-Extensions-For-Google-Drive_Save-Text-to-Google-Drive" width="550" height="337" /><br />
<a style="color: #86c177;" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-text-to-google-drive/gkcckpoladnboalokmkldjabamjpkafo" target="_blank">Save Text to Google Drive</a> (Free)</p>
<h3><strong>13) Drive Notepad</strong></h3>
<p>You can view and edit all kinds of text documents in your browser with this extension. It includes syntax highlighting for majority of scripting and programming languages.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15117" src="http://clouddock.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Chrome-Extensions-For-Google-Drive_Drive-NotePad.jpg" alt="Chrome-Extensions-For-Google-Drive_Drive-NotePad" width="550" height="337" /></p>
<p><a style="color: #86c177;" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/drive-notepad/gpgjomejfimnbmobcocilppikhncegaj" target="_blank">Drive Notepad</a> (Free)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you one of those people who used Rapportive to find email addresses or information about the people you&#8217;re talking to? The <a style="color: #86c177;" href="https://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a> of old is very much dead and buried and while it still exists and you can still use it, all of thefunctionality that drew users to it in the first place is now unfortunately gone. Fortunately for all its fans a lot of good alternatives have popped up since LinkedIn neutered the once awesome tool.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>FullContact</strong></h3>
<p><a style="color: #86c177;" href="https://www.fullcontact.com/gmail/">FullContact</a> is an awesome replacement for Rapportive! Similar to Rapportive, users are able to type in or hover over a new email address in order to see detailed contact information in the sidebar of your inbox, including things like their name, location, Job Title, Company , recent tweets, and links to their social networks. It even goes a step further than the Rapportive of old by displaying rich company information. You&#8217;ll be able to see things like the company&#8217;s founding date, company size, phone number, address and more.</p>
<p>FullContact also allows you to make notes and tag people. The only caveat with this feature is after 5,000 contacts , you&#8217;ll have to upgrade to a premium account, but I&#8217;m guessing that having 5,000 contacts is a good problem to have so shelling out the $9.99 per month won&#8217;t be too big an issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-879 aligncenter" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Rapportive_Alternatives_FullContact.jpg" alt="Rapportive Alternative FullContact" width="480" height="456" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Rapportive_Alternatives_FullContact-158x150.jpg 158w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Rapportive_Alternatives_FullContact-400x380.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Rapportive_Alternatives_FullContact-300x285.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Rapportive_Alternatives_FullContact.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /><br />
<a style="color: #86c177;" href="https://www.fullcontact.com/gmail/" target="_blank">FullContact</a>(Free) | Availability <a style="color: #86c177;" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fullcontact-for-gmail/cnaibnehbbinoohhjafknihmlopdhhip?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a> &amp; <a style="color: #86c177;" href="https://www.fullcontact.com/iphone/" target="_blank">iOS</a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Vibe</strong></h3>
<p><a style="color: #86c177;" href="https://vibeapp.co/" target="_blank">VibeApp</a> is also a very slick-looking alternative to Rapportive and it pulls in a lot of data. Like the rest of the competitors Rapportive throne VibeApp pulls up detailed contact information, links to their social profiles, organizations they&#8217;ve worked for, and associated websites in the sidebar of your inbox. It also pulls out topics or keywords that best describes the person but having tested it with a few email addresses its a bit hit and miss.</p>
<p>There are a few key differentiators between VibeApp and those trying to replace Rapportive. Firstly, it isn&#8217;t restricted to your inbox, it will work across your browser anywhere that an email address is displayed. For example, if you see someone&#8217;s email address on LinkedIn all you have to do is hover your mouse over it and it will show you all the other social accounts associated with that email address. Secondly, it&#8217;s not limited to a single email address in a message.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sidekick</strong></h3>
<p><a style="color: #86c177;" href="http://www.getsidekick.com/" target="_blank">Sidekick</a> by Hubspot is a very need alternative to Rapportive giving you a wealth of contact insight in your inbox. It has all the functionality of Rapportive and a lot, lot more! In the sidebar of your inbox you&#8217;ll see your contacts social profiles,  all their recent tweets, location, and their professional history. Now for the more part. Sidekick will show you your email history with that contact. It tracks and analyzes the behaviors of the person that receives your email so you can see exactly what they did with it.</p>
<p>Now for the more part! Sidekick will also show you your email history with that contact. It tracks and analyzes the behaviors of the person that receives your email so you can see exactly what they did with it. How many times your email has been opened, if they clicked on the link in the email, what device they read your email on. Really useful insights so you can determine  the effectiveness of your email strategy. For example, if a potential client is reading your emails on their phone, you will want to tailor your content to be as short and concise as possible whereas if they&#8217;re on their laptop you may want to go into a bit more depth.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Discover.ly</strong></h3>
<p><a style="color: #86c177;" href="http://discover.ly/" target="_blank"><strong>Discoverly</strong></a> also sheds light on your email contacts regardless if you have been in contact with them before. It shows you all relevant info and social connections about email contacts. It&#8217;s similar to VibeApp in that you can view more data about your connections when viewing profiles across the web. For example, you can see your mutual Facebook friends on LinkedIn, or see Facebook and LinkedIn info on Twitter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-882" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Rapportive_Alternatives_Discoverly.jpg" alt="Rapportive Alternative Discoverly" width="480" height="456" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Rapportive_Alternatives_Discoverly-158x150.jpg 158w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Rapportive_Alternatives_Discoverly-400x380.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Rapportive_Alternatives_Discoverly-300x285.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Rapportive_Alternatives_Discoverly.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Bottom Line</strong></h3>
<p>When it comes to the best alternative to Rapportive I would have to go with <a style="color: #86c177;" href="https://www.fullcontact.com/gmail/">FullContact</a>. This is due to the quality of data you get back and it is also useful to make notes on each contact. That said the data quality ofHubspots <a style="color: #86c177;" href="http://www.getsidekick.com/" target="_blank">Sidekick</a> is just as good as it appears it is powered by <a style="color: #86c177;" href="https://www.fullcontact.com/gmail/">FullContact</a> and it adds on a ton of features like tracking your email history with a contact which is really handy. It does seem that the search for a good replacement to Rapportive is now over with there being a lot of good options out there now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="supporttitle">How to import email addresses?</h3>
<p>You can currently import email addresses to Birdleaf by uploading a spreadsheet containing the email addresses you wish to analyze.</p>
<p>You can add spreadsheets in the following formats to Birdleaf:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload a .CSV file <img src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/support_email_format_csv.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></li>
<li>Upload a .XLS file <img src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/support_email_format_xls.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></li>
<li>Upload a .XLSX file <img src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/support_email_format_xlsx.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="faqtitle"><strong>Uploading a file</strong></p>
<p>When uploading a file to you need to ensure all column names are deleted to make sure there are no issues with the upload.</p>
<p><a href="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/birdleaf_support_add_emails_column.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-952" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/birdleaf_support_add_emails_column.jpg" alt="birdleaf_support_add_emails_column" width="500" height="340" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/birdleaf_support_add_emails_column-221x150.jpg 221w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/birdleaf_support_add_emails_column-400x272.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/birdleaf_support_add_emails_column-300x204.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/birdleaf_support_add_emails_column.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="faqtitle"><strong>Check the format.</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the only formats thatBirdleaf supports are CSV (.csv) or Excel (.xlsx, .xls). When saving your spreadsheet just double check that it&#8217;s in one of these formats to avoid any issues. When a file is uploaded in the wrong format an error message will display.</p>
<p><a href="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/support_birdleaf_wrong_fomat.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-953 aligncenter" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/support_birdleaf_wrong_fomat.jpg" alt="support_birdleaf_wrong_fomat" width="500" height="340" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/support_birdleaf_wrong_fomat-221x150.jpg 221w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/support_birdleaf_wrong_fomat-400x272.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/support_birdleaf_wrong_fomat-300x204.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/support_birdleaf_wrong_fomat.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p id="faqtitle"><strong>Uploaded a file and dashboard is empty?</strong></p>
<p>This can sometimes happen if you uploaded a file in a correct format but haven&#8217;t deleted the column names. If you&#8217;ve tried to upload your list and have been unsuccessful try deleting all unnecessary columns and rows.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/support_addemails_columns_rows.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-955" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/support_addemails_columns_rows.jpg" alt="support_addemails_columns_rows" width="500" height="340" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/support_addemails_columns_rows-221x150.jpg 221w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/support_addemails_columns_rows-400x272.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/support_addemails_columns_rows-300x204.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/support_addemails_columns_rows.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>If your emails are currently in <strong>column A</strong>  and you&#8217;re dashboard is empty then you can let us know <a href="http://app.birdleaf.io/#/support/">here</a> and we&#8217;ll get back to you straight away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="faqtitle"><b>How big a list can be uploaded?</b></p>
<p>If you are having issues uploading a very large list consider breaking the list into smaller chunks of 50,000 subscribers for the upload. If that still doesn&#8217;t work please <a href="http://app.birdleaf.io/#/support/">contact us directly</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="faqtitle"><b>Can I add emails to my existing list?</b></p>
<p>Yes. You can add email addresses to an existing list or to a new list. Just select which list you wish to add emails to from the drop down menu at the top of the screen and add the file you wish to upload.</p>

<p><strong>Why is there data missing for some email addresses?</strong></p>
<p>This can happen because there is no publicly available information for that email address of the user. Often this happens when a user keeps all their information tied to their personal email address, but is using their work account for your product.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can I filter through the raw data?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. To filter through the raw data you can input a parameter into the text box beneath the field you want to filter. For example, if you type CEO into the job field you will be returned with the emails of those people matching your criteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can I email specific people directly from birdleaf?  </strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately we don&#8217;t support this functionality. If there is an integration to a email marketing service you would like to have please <a href="http://app.birdleaf.io/#/support/">let us know</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Where does birdleaf get its data?</strong></p>
<p>We combine information from hundreds of public websites, social networks, APIs and trusted partners.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> You can currently filter through and export the raw data <a href="http://app.birdleaf.io/#/raw-data">here</a>. You currently have 3 options when exporting the raw data. Firstly you can export all the raw data we&#8217;ve collected on your customers.  Alternatively you can just export the data visible in your table incase you&#8217;ve been filtering it based on parameters such as Full Name and Age. Finally you have the option to export the specific data points you want by unchecking the options you don&#8217;t want to export.</p>
<p>Just follow the steps below to export your raw data:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">1. Select the <strong>drop down menu</strong> from the top right hand corner of the table.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">2. Filter though the raw data you want to export. You can either export all the raw data or export based on parameters such as Full Name and Age.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 150px;"><a href="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Raw-data-export.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-859" style="border-color: #69d291;" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Raw-data-export.jpg" alt="Raw-data-export" width="240" height="350" border="1" /></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"> 3. The raw data will download once you select and option.</p>
<p><strong>Safari Users</strong></p>
<p>Currently if you are using Safari there is one extra step you will have to take when exporting the data. Follow the steps as outlined above. When you select <strong>Export all data </strong>or <strong>Export visible data</strong> you will be redirected to a new tab with all the raw data scattered across the page. To download it you&#8217;ll need to right click on the page and select <strong>Save Page As&#8230;</strong> from the drop down menu. You will then be presented with a pop up with one of the options being <strong>Format</strong>.  From this drop down menu you&#8217;ll need to select <strong>Page Source</strong> and click <strong>Save</strong>. The final thing you&#8217;ll need to do is change to the file extension from <strong>.</strong><strong>txt</strong> to <strong>.csv</strong>. To do this you need to rename the file and simply change the text <strong>.txt</strong> at the end of the name to <strong>.csv</strong> and you&#8217;ll be able to access your raw data.</p>
<p>If you experience any issues please <a href="http://app.birdleaf.io/#/support"><span style="color: red;">let us know</span></a>.</p>
