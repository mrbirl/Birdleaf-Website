				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can I export raw data?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. You can currently filter through and export the raw data <a href="http://app.birdleaf.io/#/raw-data">here</a>. For tips on exporting the raw data just click <a href="http://birdleaf.io/exporting-raw-data">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why is there data missing for some email addresses?</strong></p>
<p>This can happen because there is no publicly available information for that email address of the user. Often this happens when a user keeps all their information tied to their personal email address, but is using their work account for your product.</p>
<p>If you have any specific questions about the data provided feel free to <a href="http://app.birdleaf.io/#/support/">contact us here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can I filter through the raw data?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. To filter through the raw data you can input a parameter into the text box beneath the field you want to filter. For example, if you type CEO into the job field you will be returned with the emails of those people matching your criteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can I email specific people directly from birdleaf?  </strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately we don&#8217;t support this functionality. If there is an integration to a email marketing service you would like to have please <a href="http://app.birdleaf.io/#/support/">let us know</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Where does birdleaf get its data?</strong></p>
<p>We combine information from hundreds of public websites, social networks, APIs and trusted partners.</p>
<p>If you have any specific questions about the data feel free to <a href="http://app.birdleaf.io/#/support/">contact us here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> You can currently filter through and export the raw data <a href="http://app.birdleaf.io/#/raw-data">here</a>. You currently have 3 options when exporting the raw data. Firstly you can export all the raw data we&#8217;ve collected on your customers.  Alternatively you can just export the data visible in your table incase you&#8217;ve been filtering it based on parameters such as Full Name and Age. Finally you have the option to export the specific data points you want by unchecking the options you don&#8217;t want to export.</p>
<p>Just follow the steps below to export your raw data:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">1. Select the <strong>drop down menu</strong> from the top right hand corner of the table.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;">2. Filter though the raw data you want to export. You can either export all the raw data or export based on parameters such as Full Name and Age.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 150px;"><a href="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Raw-data-export.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-859" style="border-color: #69d291;" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Raw-data-export.jpg" alt="Raw-data-export" width="240" height="350" border="1" /></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px;"> 3. The raw data will download once you select and option.</p>
<p><strong>Safari Users</strong></p>
<p>Currently if you are using Safari there is one extra step you will have to take when exporting the data. Follow the steps as outlined above. When you select <strong>Export all data </strong>or <strong>Export visible data</strong> you will be redirected to a new tab with all the raw data scattered across the page. To download it you&#8217;ll need to right click on the page and select <strong>Save Page As&#8230;</strong> from the drop down menu. You will then be presented with a pop up with one of the options being <strong>Format</strong>.  From this drop down menu you&#8217;ll need to select <strong>Page Source</strong> and click <strong>Save</strong>. The final thing you&#8217;ll need to do is change to the file extension from <strong>.</strong><strong>txt</strong> to <strong>.csv</strong>. To do this you need to rename the file and simply change the text <strong>.txt</strong> at the end of the name to <strong>.csv</strong> and you&#8217;ll be able to access your raw data.</p>
<p>If you experience any issues please <a href="http://app.birdleaf.io/#/support"><span style="color: red;">let us know</span></a>.</p>
